#To Do

## Add additional tables
Add additional tables to the Tool. Will need to check what tables are available via [the Census API](https://www.census.gov/developers/data/). 

- [2010 SF1 Available Data](https://www.census.gov/developers/data/sf1.xml)

## Support additional Census geometries
Is it worth adding support for Counties, MCDs, CDPs, etc?

[TIGERWeb does support a large array of Census geometry data](http://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/tigerwebmain/TIGERweb_restmapservice.html), so it is available. 

## Support additional Census demographic products

Support for:

- [ACS offerings](http://www.census.gov/acs/www/)
- [LEHD](http://lehd.ces.census.gov/)
- [Economic Census](http://www.census.gov/econ/census/)

## Other
Suggestions welcome.
